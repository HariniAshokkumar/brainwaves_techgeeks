UBIQSERVE: Making lives easier and simpler

Our application solves 2 problems :

Problem 1 : This problem basically deals with parents and children. Parents deposit some money into their children's account. And children can spend it when they
want(Example : Hanging out with friends).[This is like their pocket money]. The parent is sent a account ststement of the child,
so this will help to track the expenses of the child and assure that the child will not spend it in a wrong way.

Problem 2 : The second problem is for the oldage people who depend on their children for Financial help.
For example : Children deposit some amount into their parent's account. The parents can use this money for their medical expenses,
travel expenses etc. The old person can just go the hospital and scan their thumbprint and get their treatment done. While the 
expenses are automatically transferred to the hospital after the customer agrees to pay.
